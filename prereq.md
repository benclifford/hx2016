prerequisites for Haskell Exchange 2016 bot tutorial
====================================================

Please try to have this installed before you come to the
tutorial. If you don't we can do it at the start but it
will slow things down.

You need stack installed. [The instructions to do that
are here](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)

You can test your installation and pre-load a number of
useful libraries by checking out this git repo and building
a test hello world program.

If you have git:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/benclifford/hx2016.git
```

or if you have a web browser, [download this zip file,
master.zip](https://github.com/benclifford/hx2016/archive/master.zip)
and uncompress it.

```
$ cd prereqs
$ stack setup
$ stack build
$ stack exec hx2016-prereqs
HASKELL EXCHANGE PREREQS BUILT OK
```

Once you have got this far, you should have a working
stack installation with most of what you need for the
hands on tutorial downloaded.

Now wait for the tutorial to begin.
